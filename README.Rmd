This repository describes IoT devices that I have made or flashed to use [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/). ESPHome allows you to easily interface sensors and control outputs using ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers for use with home automation platforms such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Sensor or output components connected to the microcontroller are described in a YAML configuration file, which is an abstracts the usual complication of finding and using good libraries for interfacing them.

Flashing a device with ESPHome provides completely local control of the device. This is important to me as it provides data privacy, reduces latency, and avoids reliance on third party providers. Here are some motivating articles for why cloud connected IoT devices can be a bad idea:

> '[Google] are sending an update to each hub to turn your perfectly fine home automation hub into a useless piece of plastic.'
>
> [*Home Assistant: Your hub should be local and open*](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2016/04/05/your-hub-should-be-local-and-open/)

> 'Owners of Amazon's own Ring smart doorbells also suddenly found the device no longer worked at all.'
>
> [*BBC: Amazon web outage breaks vacuums and doorbells*](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55087054)

Taking control of commercially available IoT devices can be tricky, so I'm very grateful to the open source contributors for making this easy!

There are several websites which help describe how to reflash these devices for local control:

- ESPHome Devices provides product descriptions and configuration files (https://www.esphome-devices.com/).
- Tasmota Supported Devices Repository is a huge list of devices that can be reflashed with Tasmota. Tasmota is another popular firmware configurator for ESP8266/ESP32 devices. If it can be flashed with Tasmota, then you can also use ESPHome. This repository is nice as it provides a table of pins for the components in the device (https://templates.blakadder.com/).
- The ESPHome cookbook provides recipes for using ESPHome with commercial and DIY devices (https://www.esphome.io/cookbook/).

Here is a table of devices that I use ESPHome with:
